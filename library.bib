В этом видео мы рассматриваем психологические преимущества периодического размышления о смерти - практики, корни которой уходят в глубь тысячелетий. Такое размышление и следующее за ним осознание может помочь найти себя и изменить свои привычки и жизнь, обрести необходимую мотивацию и стать стимулом под саморазвитие, очистить свою жизнь от лишнего, перестроить её под "минимализм" и глубокую осознанность. Цитаты из видео: "Колыбель качается над бездной, и здравый смысл говорит нам, что жизнь – только щель слабого света между двумя вечностями тьмы" (Владимир Набоков, "Говори, память: мемуары") “Как странно, что эта единственная очевидность и общность почти совсем не беспокоят людей и они менее всего чувствуют свое братство в смерти!” Фридрих Ницше, “Весёлая Наука” "Практически каждый большой мыслитель думал и писал о смерти… многие приходили к заключению, что смерть – неотъемлемая часть жизни, и, постоянно принимая ее в расчет, мы обогащаем жизнь, а отнюдь не обкрадываем ее". "Хотя физическая смерть разрушает человека, идея смерти может его спасти". (Ирвин Ялом, "Экзистенциальная психотерапия") "Те, кто среди стремлений и надежд живут исключительно в будущем, всегда смотрят вперед и с нетерпением спешат навстречу грядущему, которое только и должно дать им истинное счастье, в то время как настоящее проходит для них без внимания и неиспользованным, – эти люди, как ни строят они глубокомысленные лица, уподобляются итальянским ослам: чтобы заставить последних идти скорее, на прикрепленной к их голове палке вешают вязанку сена, которую они поэтому постоянно видят перед самыми глазами и надеются схватить. Ибо здесь человек сам отнимает у себя все свое существование, так как все время живет лишь ad interim (лат.: предварительно), – пока не умрет". (Артур Шопенгауэр, “О нашем поведении по отношению к себе”) "Цена любой вещи - это количество жизни, которое вы на нее обмениваете" (Генри Дэвид Торо) "Где нас ожидает смерть, мы не можем знать; поэтому, со своей стороны, ожидайте ее везде" (Сенека) "Ограниченность удовольствия только увеличивает его ценность" (Зигмунд Фрейд) "Только перед лицом смерти по-настоящему рождается человек" (Святой Августин)},

From 1961 to 1963, Feynman delivered a series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from these famous Lectures on Physics, represent the most accessible material from the series.~In these classic lessons, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, energy, gravitation, quantum mechanics, and the relationship of physics to other topics. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion with a minimum of jargon. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations, Six Easy Pieces is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible physicists of modern times.~"If one book was all that could be passed on to the next generation of scientists it would undoubtedly have to be Six Easy Pieces."- John Gribbin, New Scientist},

From 1961 to 1963, Feynman delivered a series of lectures at the California Institute of Technology that revolutionized the teaching of physics.~In Six Not-So-Easy Pieces, taken from these famous Lectures on Physics, Feynman delves into one of the most revolutionary discoveries in twentieth-century physics: Einstein's theory of relativity. The idea that the flow of time is not a constant, that the mass of an object depends on its velocity, and that the speed of light is a constant no matter what the motion of the observer, at first seemed shocking to scientists and laymen alike. But as Feynman shows, these tricky ideas are not merely dry principles of physics, but things of beauty and elegance.~No one — not even Einstein himself — explained these difficult, anti-intuitive concepts more clearly, or with more verve and gusto, than Feynman. Filled with wonderful examples and clever illustrations,~Six Not-So-Easy Pieces~is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of physics by one of the most admired and accessible physicists of all time.~“There is no better explanation for the scientifically literate layman.” –Washington Post Book World},

Серия имела сравнительно большой коммерческий успех в России и, по словам представителя издательства «Эксмо», которое её издавало, первая книга быстро разошлась тиражом в 100 тысяч экземпляров. Насчитывает 14 книг и к 2016 году выдержала семь переизданий. Действие следующего фэнтези-цикла Емца, «Мефодий Буслаев», частично перекликается с «Таней Гроттер», происходя в том же сеттинге. Хотя сам Дмитрий Емец утверждал, что изначально писал «Таню Гроттер» как пародию на серию романов «Гарри Поттер» Джоан Роулинг, менеджеры последней подали на него в голландский (так как первое иноязычное издание вышло в Нидерландах) суд по обвинению в плагиате. Процесс завершился победой Роулинг, в результате чего за пределами РФ была издана только первая книга цикла.},
